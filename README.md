# Button Ripple Effect

This is a study aiming for making some practice with HTML-CSS-JavaScript.  
With this project, we added a button in the middle of the page. And when mouse hover over the button we added an effect occurs at the same time.
In this tutorial we learned basically;  
- How to use overflow: hidden, z-index, ::before and :hover::before properties and how to add a variable in a properties (for instance; left: var(--xPos) etc) in CSS,
- How to use querySelector method and how to find page's x and y coordinates in JS.
